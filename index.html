                    <p>Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,
                      through casual or organized participation, at least in part aim to use, maintain or improve
                      physical
                      ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for
                      spectators. Sports can bring positive results to one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist,
                      from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous
                      participants,
                      either in teams or competing as individuals.</p>
                    <p>In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively,
                      with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed
                      the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide
                      tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a
                      tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in
                      a
                      regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>
                    <p>Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition,
                      and
                      allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as
                      scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring
                      elements
                      of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical
                      performance or artistic impression.</p>
